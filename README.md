# Payroll Database Design with MySQL

## Overview

This repository documents the creation of a MySQL database for managing payroll information an activity part of my Data Skills Bootcamp.
The process involves defining entities, creating tables, populating data, and building an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using MySQL Workbench.

## The Instructions were:

1. Create a new database in MySQL Workbench.
2. Define entities and attributes, create tables, and associate each entity with its attributes.
3. Utilize an online Excel to SQL converter (to convert data from the CSV file to SQL statements).
4. Establish relationships by adding primary and foreign keys.
